		<h1>The noise without the social distraction</h1>
<p>
A good coffee shop is an oasis for the creative mind. It’s where you go to get away from the bad habits and distractions of your home office. It’s where you go to get your creativity flowing and to get some work done.
</p>
<p>
However, there’s a catch to real world chatter: when the human brain perceives a sound it considers to be speech, it will focus on it and turn it into meaningful language. This usually happens in spaces where the ambient noise level is low, like in modern "open space" offices. This is bad for both concentration and creativity: you try to focus on your work, but your brain keeps on processing speech in the background, interrupting you as soon as some intelligible speech has been decoded.
</p>
<p>
The key then is to find a way to have the background noise approximate the sound of human speech without any discernible words. And that’s exactly what we’ve done with our Cafe Restaurant noise generator.
</p>
<p>
You can use Cafe Restaurant as a creativity booster - <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/full/10.1086/665048">this study</a> explains how - or to add ambiance in a too-quiet space. But its true power is revealed when used to mask distracting noises like workplace chatter or nearby conversations.
</p>
<p>
To deal with these problematic sounds, pop your headphones on and adjust the volume of myNoise high enough to mask it. After a few minutes your brain will stop trying to decode the babble and the noise will recede into the background. If some real world sounds intrude, they will be heard as babble noise and will no longer pose any sort of distraction to your work.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note: unfortunately we have yet to develop a myNoise coffee generator, so until then you will have to provide your own caffeine fix!</em>

Depending on my mood and need for focus, I switch up the presets in this.

It has this productive yet calming vibe to me. </span><br><br>

As a POC, I feel uneasy listening to this as it sounds like I'm surrounded by a bunch of uppity, gossipy white housewives. Please add some diversity to the voices? [Editor: have a try with the African Town sound generator, there you can get a coffee with locals, in Senegal.]</span><br><br>

This is my happy place (fake sob)! Being on COVID lockdown in a tiny apartment with my partner and our 12 year old boy, there's only so many places to hide.

This soundscape is so awesome! I love the chill atmosphere in Coffee Shops. The quiet chattering makes feel super comfy, and makes me go into a kind of &quot;flow state&quot; in which I'm able to concentrate on work or homework really well.
My favorite setting is the Subtle Animation Mode. This makes the atmosphere change ever so slightly over time so that it feels both unnoticeable AND naturally varied.</span><br><br>

This can quite helpfully cut out the noise of mechanical keyboards on the other side of the office. The pseudo babble channel does have some quite harsh whispers though, so I took them out.

Somehow, some idle chatter gave me the sudden urge to finally get around to doing what I've been supposed to do for a couple days now.

I actually love using this in actual coffee shops when I come to study. If the noises in the room are particularly loud or if the cafe is full and there is a lot of conversation then this helps me to focus on my work and not get constantly distracted by what's around me.

I've been adjusting to the sheer amount of work I have to complete and revise at A-level, and the sound of a coffee shop in the background can keep me concentrated for hours on end, which really is a life saver! Thank you so much for providing this amazing noise. :)</span><br><br>
